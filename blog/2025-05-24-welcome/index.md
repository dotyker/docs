Introducing Dotyker, the digital screen system everyone needs, but this time it is FOSS!

Find out what you can expect from this project.

Our early goals will be creating some real-world examples, replacing our existing digital screen solutions and creating blogs and documentation about it. Then sharing on social media and getting your feedback! Please help us make this project useful for community!
